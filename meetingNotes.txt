Which the recommendation strategy will help chart creation the most?
Voyager has a narrow definition of data exploration
Insight discovery (Forsight, SeeDB) - depth first
Data coverage (Voyager) - breadth first

we can compare the breadth first (voyager) and depth first (show full path but different directions)

after the interview, asking:
What other tasks you think you can do with the current recommendation system?

Three level of controls:
- No recommendations at all (no grouping strategies)
- People can add fields
- No control at all


Different grouping strategies:

- design complexity (# of encodings)
- random / 1 group (Vizdeck / Tableau)
- task type (harder)
- visualization type (line chart, bar chart, ...)
- attribute type (voyager)
- progression of chart variation / complexity (sequence grouping?)

breadth first (voyager)
depth first 1 (polestar)
depth first 2 (progression of charts)

5 in total 
1. polestar (clicking on field, checkbox, auto pick encodings)
2. polestar + breath first
3. polestar + depth first
4. breath first
5. depth first
